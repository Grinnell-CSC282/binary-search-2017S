Welcome to the Microgoogazonbook binary search task
===================================================

You will see a `search` procedure described in the file `search.h`.
Implement that procedure using the binary search algorithm.  Store
your implementation in `USERID.c`, substituting your own user id.
The file `_stub.c` contains a stub implementation to speed your
development.

You may find it useful to check it by linking with `check.c`.  We
have included a Makefile to ease that work.  If you don't want to use
the Makefile, we'd suggest the following command.

    $ gcc -g -Wall check.c USERID.c -o USERID.check

Feel free to modify `check.c`.  You might even score some bonus
points if you add particularly good checks to that file and upload
them to the repoistory.

When you are confident that your binary search algorithm is implemented
correctly please upload it to the repository.
